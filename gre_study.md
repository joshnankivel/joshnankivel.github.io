Week One, Day One

1. [ ] Go to ETS.org, and read about the content of the GRE.  Click on and read each sub-heading link.
2. In the Official Guide,
	- [ ] Read Chapter 1 “Introducing the GRE revised General Test”
	- [ ] Read Chapter 2 “GRE Analytic Writing”—skim or skip the example essays and the commentary on them, and read everything else
	- [ ] Read Chapter 3 “GRE Verbal Reasoning”—just the introductory pages, before the Sample Question Set
	- [ ] Read Chapter 5 “GRE Quantitative Reasoning”—just the introductory pages, before the Sample Questions
3. [ ] Start reading through the GRE Math Review in the Official Guide, up to the Arithmetic Exercises.  Take notes in your journal on whatever is unfamiliar.  Do the Arithmetic Exercises and correct your answers.

NOTE: Many GRE test takers struggle with remembering math, so for these readers, I am suggesting this first week working through of the Official Guide’s Math Review section.  If you are someone for whom math comes easily, I would say: skim this section, do the exercises, and spend the rest of the time devoted to this building your vocabulary, using our flashcards and possibly more, such as Princeton Review’s book Word Smart.

4. In Magoosh Lessons, watch the following videos:
	- [ ] In Intro to the GRE: watch all 10 videos
	- [ ] In Math: watch the first 5 videos
	- [ ] In Verbal: watch the first 3 videos

If the content in the video is new to you or relatively unclear, take notes on it in your journal.  If the content is very familiar, feel free to click ahead to the summary at the end, just to verify that you understand it all.

 

Week One, Day Two

1) Continue reading through the GRE Math Review, up to about halfway through the Algebra section.  Take notes in your journal on whatever is unfamiliar.

2) In Magoosh Lessons, watch the following videos:

In Math: watch the next 10 videos

In Verbal: watch the next 4 videos

NOTE: If you are close to finishing a module you want to finish, feel free to move a lesson or two up a day or back a day so you can finish the module.  As long as you are reading these average numbers, some give-and-take is fine.  Also, when you get to end of a module, take the quiz, and keep reviewing until you pass the quiz.

3) In Magoosh’s GRE Flashcards, begin and master a new deck, if possible.

4) In Magoosh Practice, in Math, do 10 Multiple Choice (MC) questions, 15 Quantitative Comparison (QC) questions, and 3 Data Interpretation (DI) questions.  Filter for “Math” in Section. Uncheck all of the Subjects (Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Data Interpretation, etc.), set the Difficulty to “Adaptive”, Question Pool to “Unanswered”, Time to “No Limit”, and Mode to “Practice Mode”. You are not entering a practice time beforehand, but keep a pace of 90 sec/question, or 15 minutes for 10 questions.

Notice you are doing ALL topics from the get-go, whether you have already studied these or not.  This means that you will make some mistakes at the beginning: see this post on a productive attitude toward making mistakes. If, after a week or so of practice, you find that there is simply too much new material for you, then narrow your studies to those topics you’re more actively studying plus one or two that you’re unfamiliar with. You should be constantly challenged. If you do narrow the topics of study, expand back to as wide a scope as possible as quickly as possible.

Also, in Verbal, do 10 Text Completion (TC) questions, 10 Sentence Equivalence (SE) questions, and 10 Reading Comprehension (RC) questions.  Similar settings as above.

NOTE: for each RC, you should do all the questions (usually 3) associated with a passage on one sitting.  This may mean you do 9 RC questions some days, and 12 some days.  That’s fine, as long as the average pace is around 10 RC questions/day.

For each Magoosh problem, after you submit your answer, on the next page which tells you whether you were right or wrong, there’s a video solution and below that a text summary.  If you got the question right, skim the text summary to verify you got it right for the right reason.  If you got the question wrong, watch the video, taking notes in your journal about any concept or any aspect of the question type that was unclear to you.

NOTE: For all math, you will doing mixed practice.  The temptation is to work on what you are studying at the moment, but that fails to simulate real test conditions.  You don’t really understand a concept until you can answer a question about it in mixed practice.  At the beginning, we know you will make mistakes on topics that you have studied in depth yet, and that’s OK.  See this post on having a productive attitude toward mistakes.   If you make mistakes and the beginning and study them well, that will prime your mind for deeper understand when you learn more about those concepts in the lessons.

In Writing: watch all 10 videos

3) Download and start reading the Magoosh GRE eBook. Continue reading whenever you have the time over the course of the next two weeks.

4) Today, you are going to write two essays, half an hour each.  You will write one Issue essay and one Argument essay.

The good news is that any prompt that you could possibly see test day is already on the ETS website: the pool of possible Issue prompts and the pool of the possible Argument prompts.

For each essay, you can choose the essay prompt at random from the respective pool, or you might want to choose an essay topic that seems challenging to you. Write the essay in a word processing program. If you can turn off the spell check all the better–you won’t have the luxury of spell check test day.  For each essay, hold yourself to a strict 30 time limit.

Now that you have these essays, what do you do with them?  If you have a friend or mentor who is a gifted writer, ask them to read the essays for you and critique them. If they are willing, you can show them the assessment criteria in the Official Guide, and ask them to follow it. If you can afford it, hire a writing coach or writing tutor: show that tutor the assessment criteria in the OG, and have them give you feedback.  If you can’t afford a writing tutor and can’t convince anyone else to read it, you may try posting them on TheGradCafe, and see whether an expert there will critique your essay.  Failing any of these options, at least you can set the essays aside, and in a couple days re-read them with the Official Guide’s rubric beside you.

Week Two, Day Six

1) Today, you are going to write two essays, half an hour each.  You will write one Issue essay and one Argument essay.

For topics, go back to the topic pools on the ETS website, and pick a topic.  Write the essays in Word.

When done, share the essays with a trusted friend/mentor, or post in TheGradCafe, or set aside and critique it yourself with the Official Guide rubric in a few days.

2) In the Official Guide:

a) do the Verbal Reasoning Practice Sets 1-6

b) do the Quantitative Reasoning Practice Sets 1-4

Treat this as a mock GRE.  You might even combine it with the two essays, and do consecutive batches 2-3 sets without interruption, to simulate more effectively a real GRE.  Set a timer for the time limits.  Here are the time limits to observe:

Verbal Reasoning Set 1 = 9 minutes

Verbal Reasoning Set 2 = 10 minutes

Verbal Reasoning Set 3 = 9 minutes

Verbal Reasoning Set 4 = 10 minutes

Verbal Reasoning Set 5 = 10 minutes

Verbal Reasoning Set 6 = 10 minutes

Quantitative Reasoning Set 1 = 22 minutes

Quantitative Reasoning Set 2 = 23 minutes

Quantitative Reasoning Set 3 = 24 minutes

Quantitative Reasoning Set 4 = 11 minutes

After you are done, check all your answers.  For any question you got right, skim the explanation to verify that you got it right for the right reason.  For any question you got wrong, read the explanation thorough, taking notes in your journal on any concepts you didn’t understand and anything about the question format that psyched you out.   If you still can’t make sense of the question after reading the explanation, email us at Magoosh.

As much as possible, try to mimic the GRE conditions.  Give yourself relatively short breaks in between sections.  Only eat the kinds of snacks that you are planning to bring to the real GRE.  Note how your sleep the night before affects your work.  Note how what you had for dinner the previous night and what you had to eat earlier that day affects your energy level and concentration.   Write any observations in your journal.

You can take a short break when you are done, but before too long, grade the entire thing while it is still fresh in your mind.  Study the solutions for any problems you got wrong, and right observations in your journal.

Week Four, Day Six

1) Today, you are going to take the practice GRE on the CD that comes with the Official Guide.  This is the Power-Prep test.  This CD will work in a Windows computer.  If you have a Mac, you can download the software at this ETS page.

As much as possible, try to mimic the GRE conditions.  Give yourself relatively short breaks in between sections.  Only eat the kinds of snacks that you are planning to bring to the real GRE.  Note how your sleep the night before affects your work.  Note how what you had for dinner the previous night and what you had to eat earlier that day affects your energy level and concentration.   Write any observations in your journal.

At the end, copy the essays you wrote into a Word doc, and as before, these you will share with a trusted friend or mentor, or post in the online forums asking for feedback, or critique later with the Official Guide rubric.  Give yourself a short break when the test is done, and then check all your work, studying carefully the questions you got wrong.

Any Remaining Days

Keep working on GRE math and verbal every day.  Suggestions

1) Keep watching 10-12 Magoosh videos a day.  Go back and re-watch any videos in which you think you need to learn the topic more thoroughly.

2) You should have answered most of the Magoosh questions at this point; you can finish any remaining questions.  You can try again Magoosh questions that you have already answered, and see if you do better on the question the second time around.

3) Keep drilling your stack of vocab cards every day

4) There’s a second Power Prep Test you can take on the computer.  There’s also another paper GRE in the back of the OG: even if you don’t take that under “test like” conditions, it still would be good to work through all the problems.

Day before the test:

1) No GRE preparation all day

2) Eat a large, healthy, leisurely dinner – no alcohol!

3) Go to bed earlier than usual.

Day of test

1) ABSOLUTELY NO LAST MINUTE GRE PREPARATION!

2) Eat a large breakfast, full of protein

3) Do relaxing, fun activities to pass time until the test

Bring to the test

1) A liter of water

2) Healthy energy-packed snacks (nuts, protein bar, etc.)

3) On breaks, make sure to get up, move & stretch – moving & stretching the large muscles of the body (legs & torso) will get oxygen flowing throughout, which will help keep you awake and keep you thinking clearly.
